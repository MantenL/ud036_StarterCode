# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

This is the first project I finished. It creates a website showing my favorite pokemon movies.

To use, open the command line tool in the same folder, and type:

`python entertainment_center.py`

# Requirements
    You should download python to run this program.
